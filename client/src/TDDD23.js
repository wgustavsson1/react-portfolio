        <p>This is a course i  read on Link√∂pings University. In this course I developed a mobile game in Unity Game Engine using C#. The game mission is to catch dollar bills falling from the crashing airplane using your pickup truck while avoiding getting hit by debris.</p>
        <p>Unfourtunately the source code from this game is lost since my university Gitlab account was closed without any notice</p>
