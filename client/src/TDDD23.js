        <p>TDDD23 - Design And Programming Of Computer Games is a course on Link√∂pings University. In this course I developed a mobile game in Unity Game Engine using C#. The game mission is to catch dollar bills falling from the crashing airplane using your pickup truck while avoiding getting hit by debris.</p>
        <p>Unfourtunately the source code of this game is lost since my university gitlab account was closed without any notice</p>
